## About
This was a challenge that the Eduick company invited me to do, so I could get a job there.
<br />
So I was told that I had 20 days to do it, thought I didn't see the e-mail in the same day, I still did the job in the 20 days from the day they sent me the e-mail.
<br />
The challenge itself can be found [here](https://github.com/edusynch/frontend-challenge).
<br />
I also made a video about it that can be seen [right here](https://youtu.be/xmDRtEEtXWo).

## Prerequisites
To run in Windows 10 you need to install some tools, like: NodeJS, Chocolatey and more. [here](https://github.com/MestreALMO/React-Requires-To-Run-Windows-) is how to install all of it.
<br/>


## Running
Access the folder ```_API-espress``` inside the project with a terminal, if it is the first time running the code don't forget to run ```yarn```, then the following code:
```
yarn dev
```
Now the API is running!

Now access the root of the project with a terminal, don't forget to run ```yarn``` if it is the first time running the project, then run the code:
```
yarn dev
```
With that the app will be running! 
<br />You can access it with ```http://localhost:3000/```
<br />Also you can see the API running at ```http://localhost:3100/```
